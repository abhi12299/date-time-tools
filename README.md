# Date-time Tools MCP

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for date-time manipulation and timezone conversion.

## Overview

This MCP server provides a set of tools for working with date-time strings, including timezone conversion, date mutation (arithmetic), and fetching the current date-time and timezone. It is designed to be used as a backend utility for applications or agents that need robust, standardized date-time operations.

## Integration with Cursor and Other MCP Clients

Go to: `Settings -> Cursor Settings -> MCP -> Add new global MCP server`

Pasting the following configuration into your Cursor `~/.cursor/mcp.json` file is the recommended approach. You may also install in a specific project by creating `.cursor/mcp.json` in your project folder. See [Cursor MCP docs](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol) for more info.
